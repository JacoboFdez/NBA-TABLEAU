# NBA DATA VISUALIZATION


![portada](images/NBALOGO.png)


The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America. The league is composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.




# OBJECTIVES



We have carried out three large branches in which we will focus our visualization, one will be to look at historical data, analyzing all the player data over time. On the other hand, we will carry out a similar visualization with the players of the regular season. And last but no less important we will carry out an analysis of the best valued Rookies at a historical level.
Analyzing the data we have been able to extract readings from the top scorers in history, the best players with a percentage of three-pointers made throughout history, etc.





In this tableau visualization we will show various statistics related to nba players from the year 97 to the present.



Next we show a small example of objects that we are going to find in our visualization :

In the image above we can differentiate the number of players per country that the NBA has hosted in the last 25 years.



To the right of it we see a radar in which the skills of scoring three points, free throws and field goals are marked. One of the main objectives of this Tableau Dashboard has been to try to recreate a radar chart that could compare some players with others.

In addition, I wanted this project to have some utility beyond tinkering within it, so I have attached previews of web pages within it to be able to consult current data and have a small informative character.

The project is in a "beta" version, so updates will be implemented in the future that will bring more content to enrich our work.
